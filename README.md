# Retina-Language
An interpreter for the language Retina, written in Ruby.

Retina is a computer language designed to convert code instructions into a pixel drawing. The manner by which this is achieved is through the abstraction of a "turtle" whose displacement in 2D leaves a tray of pixels behind.

Complex shapes can be drawn by means of tracing basic lines, curves, and even skipping pixels.

The project holds a folder containing some samples of what can be achieved through the use of few lines of code. 

# Requirements
* Ruby 2.5.1

# Instructions
Just run "retina <filename.rtn>"
